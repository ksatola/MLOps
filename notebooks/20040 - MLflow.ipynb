    "In order to address common frictions for developing models in data science we need to provide data scientists and practitioners with a standardized environment in which they can develop and manage their work. A data science workbench should allow you to quick-start a project, and the availability of an environment with a set of starting tools and frameworks allows data scientists to rapidly jump-start a project.\n",

    "\n",
    "We need the following core features in our data science workbench:\n",
    "- **Dependency Management:** Having dependency management built into your local environment helps in handling reproducibility issues and preventing library conflicts between different environments. This is generally achieved by using environment managers such as Docker or having environment management frameworks available in your programming language. MLflow provides this through the support of Docker- or Conda-based environments.\n",
    "- **Data Management:** Managing data in a local environment can be complex and daunting if you have to handle huge datasets. Having a standardized definition of how you handle data in your local projects allows others to freely collaborate on your projects and understand the structures available.\n",
    "- **Model Management:** Having the different models organized and properly stored provides an easy structure to be able to work through many ideas at the same time and persist the ones that have potential. MLflow helps support this through the model format abstraction and Model Registry component to manage models.\n",
    "- **Deployment:** Having a development environment aligned with the production environment where the model will be serviced requires deliberation in the local environment. The production environment needs to be ready to receive a model from a model developer, with the least possible friction. This smooth deployment workflow is only possible if the local environment is engineered correctly.\n",
    "- **Experimentation Management:** Tweaking parameters is the most common thing that a machine learning practitioner does. Being able to keep abreast of the different versions and specific parameters can quickly become cumbersome for the model developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have the following components in the architecture of our development environment:\n",
    "- **Docker/Docker Compose:** Docker will be used to handle each of the main component dependencies of the architecture, and Docker Compose will be used as a coordinator between different containers of software pieces. The advantage of having each component of the workbench architecture in Docker is that neither elementâ€™s libraries will conflict with the other.\n",
    "- **JupyterLab:** The de facto environment to develop data science code and analytics in the context of machine learning.\n",
    "- **MLflow:** MLflow is at the cornerstone of the workbench, providing facilities for experiment tracking, model management, registry, and deployment interface.\n",
    "- **PostgreSQL database:** The PostgreSQL database is part of the architecture at this stage, as the storage layer for MLflow for backend metadata. Other relational databases could be used as the MLflow backend for metadata, but we will use PostgreSQL."
