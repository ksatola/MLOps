    "## Introduction to Kubernetes\n",
    "**Kubernetes (K8s)** (K8s -> \"kates\") is an orchestrator of cloud-native microservices applications. The name **Kubernetes** comes from the Greek word meaning `helmsman`, a nautical/sailing term for the person that steers a ship. The wheel of a ship is also called the `helm`. **Microservices** application is made of lots of small, specialised parts that are losely coupled to create a usefyl application. **Cloud-native** apps can self-heal, automatically scale, and be updated without downtime. An **orchestrator** brings together a set of microservices and organises them into an application that brings value, provides and manages cloud-native features such as scaling, self-healing, and updates. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Kubernetes** does an amazing job of abstracting underlying cloud and server infrastructure, so you don't have to care what cloud or servers your apps are running on. **Kuberenetes** is called `the operating system of the cloud`. Applications written for Kubernetes will run anywhere that you have Kubernetes. K8s apps can:\n",
    "- be deployed to one cloud today and be re-deployed to another tomorrow,\n",
    "- run multi-cloud,\n",
    "- be more easily ramp onto a cloud and then ramp off back to on-prem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call a Kubernetes installation (one or more machines installed with Kubernetes) a `Kubernetes cluster`. The machines can be physical servers, virtual machines, cloud instances, a laptop, Raspberry Pi, and more. We refer to machines in K8s cluster as `nodes`. There are two types of nodes: master and worker. `Masters` (master nodes) host the `control plane` (brains of the cluster) and (worker) `Nodes` are where you run user applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Masters** run many services that form the control pane but the `API Server` is the only part of Kubernetes cluster you directly interact with. **Nodes** run Linux or Windows user applications. The `Scheduler` chooses which Nodes to run user applications on. The `Store` is where the state of the cluster and all applications is stored. The `Cloud controller` allows K8s to integrate with cloud services such as storage and load-balancers.\n",
    "\n",
    "All Nodes run a couple of services including `Kubelet` (main Kubernetes agent) and `Container runtime` (starts and stops containers). Most of the day-to-day management of K8s cluster is done using the Kubernetes command line toll called **kubectl** (\"kube see tee ell\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Kubernetes orchestrates and runs containers, these containers must be wrapped in a Kubernetes construct called a `Pod`. Kubernetes uses `labels` to associate objects. Pods carry labels, whereas Service objects use them to make selections.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kubernetes** came into existence in the summer of 2014 as an open-source next gext generation of Borg and Omega (Google's internal tools) for managing containers."
